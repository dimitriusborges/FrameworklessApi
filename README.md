## First, the disclaimer

Since I'm migrating from embedded software development to Back-end, I'm starting a series of projects, this one here being the very first one, to learn and practice. 

I have no compromise to keep it fully functional or to make something quasi state-of-the-art, but I do want to make everything **"right"**, i.e., with good practices. 

If anything looks "wrong" it might be because I dunno (yet) how to make it properly.

# FrameworklessApi

The intent of this project is to create a Rest API without the help of any framework. Yes,no Spring, no Javalin or any other framework. Just the good and old java and JDBC.
Mind you, it is just for study, exploration and adventure.


### The problem to solve
